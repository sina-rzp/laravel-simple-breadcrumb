# laravel-simple-breadcrumb
A very simple breadcrumb, to be added to the master blade. 

1- Under your 'views', you may go ahead and clone this breadcrumb. 

2- Once cloned, breadcrumb.blade.php must be added. 

3- You are then required to include this blade in your master blade (master.blade.php in most cases).

@include('breadcrumb')

4- Done!
